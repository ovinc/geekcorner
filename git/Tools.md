# External tools

## GUI

- GitKraken : does not allow local repos in free version --> not cool

- SmartGit : free only if for not-commercial use

- SourceTree : free, but not available for linux


## CLI diff tools

### diff-so-fancy

https://gitbetter.substack.com/p/how-to-customize-git-diff-to-spot
https://github.com/so-fancy/diff-so-fancy

(installable with npm which is automatically installed by anaconda. If not, use homebrew on mac).

Be careful using npm to use the global option (if not it installs in the current directory)
npm install diff-so-fancy --global

(note: requires Perl to be installed. I could not install ActiveState Perl on manip-liquint so I installed Strawberry Perl, it seems to work ok)

###  nbdime
