## Visual mode

Accessed by pressing `v`.
Once the mode is entered, moving the cursor creates a selection.
One can then copy/cut etc.

| Key | Action |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `y` | Copy (*yank*) |
| `d` | Cut (*delete*) |
| `p` | Paste (*put*) |
| `:sort ui` | Sort vselection (multiple lines) by alphabetical order of first character |


## Visual block mode

Accessed by pressing `Ctrl v`.

A lot of cool stuff can be done in there, including multi-line editing and macros, see e.g.
