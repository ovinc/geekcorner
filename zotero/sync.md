# Zotero sync

## WebDAV with s-Drive (Nextcloud CNRS)

First, create an **application password** within the web application of s-Drive:
- click on your profile icon (top right)
- got to Parameters > Security
- click "Create new application password" (WebDAV section, bottom)
*NOTE*: copy the generated ID and password in a safe location, as it is not retrievable later.

Then, find the **WebDAV URL address** by going in "File Parameters" (main s-Drive window, bottom left), e.g.
`https://sdrive.cnrs.fr/remote.php/dav/files/337228`

Finally, go to **Zotero sync settings**, in Settings > Sync > File Syncing and check the box
*Sync attachment files using WebDAV*
and put the login and URL address info from above.
